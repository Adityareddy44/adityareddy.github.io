						<!-- Projects -->
							<article id="Projects">
								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<h3>Weather Application</h3>
								<p>&emsp;● Developed a User-friendly interface that displays information such as weather &emsp;&emsp;temperature, humidity, etc.<br>
								&emsp;● Dynamic display of weather information, automatically updating when the users &emsp;&emsp;location changes.<br>
								&emsp;● Utilised React to create reusable UI components and Integrated OpenWeatherMap &emsp;&emsp;API to retrieve weather data.<br>
								&emsp;● Achieved a 30% reduction in API response time.<br></p>
								
								<h3>Personal Portfolio Website </h3>
								<p>&emsp;● Developed a personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and other &emsp;&emsp;information using a template from HTML5 UP.<br>
									&emsp;● The website includes a clean and visually appealing design to highlight my work &emsp;&emsp;effectively. <br>
									&emsp;● Hosted the portfolio on GitHub to make it accessible to potential employers and &emsp;&emsp;collaborators.<br>
									</p>
								<h3>GIVEAWAY TWITTER SEARCH ENGINE</h3>
								<p> &emsp;● Developed a search engine dedicated to Giveaway tweets using the Twitter API, &emsp;&emsp;PyLucene, and BERT. <br>
									&emsp;● Gathered around 50,000 tweets containing specific giveaway-related hashtags and &emsp;&emsp;keywords, and indexed them with PyLucene and BERT for efficient retrieval. <br>
									&emsp;● Created a user-friendly web interface where users can search for giveaways using &emsp;&emsp;keywords, filter results by date range, and view relevant tweet information such as &emsp;&emsp;scores, usernames etc.<br>
									</p>
								<h3>Pac-Man Game </h3>
								<p>&emsp;● Designing an intelligent Pacman agent that is able to find optimal paths through its &emsp;&emsp; maze world considering both reaching particular locations (e.g., finding all the &emsp;&emsp; corners) and eating all the dots in as few steps as possible.<br>
									&emsp;● Implemented a graph search algorithms using BFS,DFS,UCS as well as A*</p>
								<h3>Random forest classifier on heart disease prediction </h3>

									</p>
								<h4>&nbsp;xv6 Threads</h4>
								<p>&emsp;● Implemented kernel-level thread support in the xv6 operating system.<br>
									&emsp;● Added a new system call 'clone()' to create child threads, sharing the same address &emsp;&emsp;space with the parent.<br> 

									</p>
								<h3>Deep Learning </h3>
								<h4>&nbsp;MNIST with Dropout and Noise</h4>
								<p> &emsp;● Implemented a shallow fully-connected neural network classifier for multiclass &emsp;&emsp;classification of the MNIST dataset using PyTorch/TensorFlow. <br>
								    &emsp;● Explored the impact of width k and dropout rate p on training and test accuracy. <br>
									&emsp;● Analysed the effects of dropout regularisation and label noise on the models.  <br>
									</p>

								<h4>&nbsp;Neural Network for MNIST</h4>
								<p>&emsp;● Developed a classifier for the MNIST dataset using a shallow neural network. <br>
									&emsp;● Utilized Xavier initialization and ReLU activation to train the model. <br>
									&emsp;● Achieved high accuracy on test data with varying numbers of hidden units (k = 5, &emsp;&emsp;40, and 200), demonstrating the impact of model complexity on optimization and &emsp;&emsp;accuracy.<br> 
									</p>
								<h4>&nbsp;Data Augmentation</h4>
								<p>&emsp;● Developed ResNet20 from scratch for classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset, exploring &emsp;&emsp;various augmentation techniques. <br>
									&emsp;● Achieved high accuracy using these methods and evaluated their impact on the &emsp;&emsp;model's performance.<br>
