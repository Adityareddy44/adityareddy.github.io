								</ul>
								
								<h3>GIVEAWAY TWITTER SEARCH ENGINE</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>● Developed a search engine dedicated to Giveaway tweets using the Twitter API, PyLucene, and BERT.</li>
									<li>● Gathered around 50,000 tweets containing specific giveaway-related hashtags and keywords, and indexed them with PyLucene and BERT for efficient retrieval. </li>
									<li>● Created a user-friendly web interface where users can search for giveaways using keywords, filter results by date range, and view relevant tweet information such as scores, usernames etc.</li>
									
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Pac-Man Game </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>● Designing an intelligent Pacman agent that is able to find optimal paths through its maze world considering both reaching particular locations (e.g., finding all the  corners) and eating all the dots in as few steps as possible.</li>
									<li>● Implemented a graph search algorithms using BFS,DFS,UCS as well as A*</li>
